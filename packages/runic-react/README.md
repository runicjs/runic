# Runic

Runic React provides tools for working with Runic in React.

> **Warning**
> Runic React is in its infancy. It's not safe to use in production at this time.

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement `useStore`
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Implement TodoMVC using runic-react
- [ ] Verify that there are no unnecessary rerenders
- [ ] Implement a larger app with more complex state using runic
- [ ] IDEA: `useComposite` (might need a clearer name)
